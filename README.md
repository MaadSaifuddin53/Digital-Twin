Digital Twin for Environmental Monitoring â€“ Coral Reef Analysis
In this project, I worked as a Data Engineer on building a Digital Twin solution using Azure Databricks and PySpark. The architecture follows a Medilain-based design, enabling efficient processing and streaming of environmental data.

The main focus was on analyzing coral reef ecosystems, where real-time data streams were ingested, processed, and transformed to generate actionable insights on environmental changes. The project demonstrates scalable data engineering pipelines for streaming and batch processing, supporting environmental monitoring and conservation efforts.
